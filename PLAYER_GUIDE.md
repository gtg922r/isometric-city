| **Large Park** | $600 | 3x3 | -25 |
| **Tennis Court** | $200 | 1x1 | -5 |
| **Basketball Court** | $250 | 1x1 | -3 |
| **Playground** | $200 | 1x1 | -5 |
| **Swimming Pool** | $450 | 1x1 | -5 |

### Special Buildings
These unique structures provide massive city-wide bonuses and demand boosts.

| Building | Cost | Size | Jobs | Impact (Demand) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **City Hall** | $6,000 | 2x2 | 60 | Res +8, Com +10, Ind +5. |
| **Museum** | $4,000 | 3x3 | 40 | Com +8 (Max +15), Res +5 (Max +10). |
| **Stadium** | $5,000 | 3x3 | 50 | Com +5 (Max +15). |
| **Airport** | $10,000 | 4x4 | 200 | Com +15, Ind +10. High Pollution. |
| **Space Program** | $15,000 | 3x3 | 150 | Ind +20, Res +10. |
| **Amusement Park** | $12,000 | 4x4 | 100 | Com +18. |

## Zoning & Growth Mechanics

### Densification (Levels)
In IsoCity, **Density** is represented by a building's **Level** (1-5).
-   **Level 1:** Low density (Small houses, small shops). Max Pop ~6.
-   **Level 3:** Medium density (Mansions, Offices). Max Pop ~18-90.
-   **Level 5:** High density (Skyscrapers, High-rises). Max Pop ~260+.

Buildings automatically "level up" when specific criteria are met, replacing their sprite with a larger, denser structure.

**Growth Formula:**
The simulation calculates a decimal target level, which is then rounded down.
`Target Level = Floor(Base + Services + Age + Demand)`

*   **Base (Land Value):** All buildable land provides a base of **2.0** levels.
*   **Services:** Average coverage % of Police, Fire, Health, and Education. Max **+3.5** levels.
*   **Age:** **+0.016** per tick. (Approx. +1 level every 2 game months).
*   **Demand:** **+0.01** per demand point above 30. (Max **+0.7** levels).

*Example: A new building (Age 0) with 50% services (1.75) and base land (2.0) = Level 3.75 -> Level 3.*

### Zone Types
| Zone | Primary Purpose | Key Requirements |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Residential** | Provides housing. | Road access, Power, Water, Low Pollution. |
| **Commercial** | Provides jobs/shopping. | Road access, Power, Water, Customers (Pop). |
| **Industrial** | Provides heavy jobs. | Road access, Power, Water, Rail/Airport connectivity. |

### Development Requirements
1.  **Road Access:** Within **8 tiles** of a road.
2.  **Utilities:** Power and Water required for Level 2+ growth.

### Abandonment & Recovery
-   **Abandonment:** Occurs when **Demand** drops below **-20** (Oversupply) for an extended time.
-   **Risk Factors:** Buildings are more likely to abandon if they have **No Power/Water** or are **Low Level** (Level 1-2).
-   **Recovery:** Abandoned buildings have a chance to be renovated when demand rises above **+10**.


## System Mechanics

Beyond zoning and building, several background systems simulate the life of your city.

### Land Value
Land Value determines the baseline potential for development.
-   **Base Value:** Most land has a value of 50/100.
-   **Waterfront:** Land near water has a value of 60/100, providing a slight head-start for growth.
-   **Effect:** Higher land value helps buildings level up faster, especially when services are still developing.

### Traffic & Pollution
-   **Traffic:** Generated by residential, commercial, and industrial activity. High traffic generates pollution.
-   **Pollution:** Factories and Power Plants generate significant pollution. It spreads to neighboring tiles and lowers the city-wide **Health** and **Environment** score, reducing overall Happiness.

### Services & Quality of Life
-   **Service Coverage:** The average coverage of Police, Fire, Health, and Education determines 50% of your ability to level up buildings. Neglecting any one service will cap your city's density.
-   **Health & Safety:** Beyond density, these contribute to the city's **Happiness** score.
-   **Environment:** Trees, water, and parks increase the Environment score, which accounts for 15% of total Happiness.

## Economy

Managing the city's budget is crucial for sustainable growth.

### Income
Your city generates revenue primarily through **Taxation**:
-   **Residential Taxes:** Based on total population.
-   **Business Taxes:** Based on total jobs in commercial and industrial zones.
-   **Base Rate:** The standard tax rate is **9%**. Raising taxes will increase immediate income but will eventually lower demand for all zones.

### Expenses
Maintaining services and infrastructure costs money every month:
-   **Service Maintenance:** Every Police Station, Fire Station, School, and Hospital has a monthly maintenance cost.
-   **Infrastructure:** Roads, Subway tracks, and Rail lines require constant upkeep.
-   **Funding Levels:** You can adjust funding for each department in the Budget panel. Lowering funding reduces service effectiveness (and coverage radius) but saves money.

### Demand Calculation
Demand is the "engine" of growth, driven by a cycle of People <-> Jobs.

**Base Calculations:**
*   **Residential Demand:** Increases when there are excess **Jobs**. `(Jobs - Pop) / 18`
*   **Commercial/Industrial Demand:** Increases when there is excess **Population**. `(Pop - Jobs) / 2`
*   **Subway Bonus:** An extensive subway network directly boosts **Commercial Demand** (up to +20).

**Modifiers:**
*   **Taxation:** Taxes above 9% reduce demand. At 20% tax, demand is crushed (-22).
*   **Special Buildings:** Provide flat bonuses (e.g., Airport +15 Com/Ind).
