- [x] Task: Create `PLAYER_GUIDE.md` with initial directory structure and Overview [Red: Verify file missing] 49eceb6
- [x] Task: Document Service Buildings (Police, Fire, Hospital, School) extracting data from `src/game/constants.ts` 920f1ae
- [x] Task: Document Infrastructure mechanics (Roads, Power, Water connectivity rules) 920f1ae
- [ ] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Phase 1: Setup & Building Catalog' (Protocol in workflow.md)

## Phase 2: Zoning & Growth Mechanics

- [ ] Task: Document Zone Types (Residential, Commercial, Industrial) and their basic functions
- [ ] Task: Document Growth Logic (Requirements for placement vs. development)
- [ ] Task: Document Leveling Up and Abandonment criteria based on `simulation.ts` logic
- [ ] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Phase 2: Zoning & Growth Mechanics' (Protocol in workflow.md)

## Phase 3: Systems & Economy
